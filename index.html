     <p>The pain itself is important, but the pain is enhanced by the adipiscing process,
	     but I give it time to cut it down so that I do some great work and pain. For the way that we can do our exercise, 
	     any school of labor, except to take advantage of the consequences from it's objectives. But the pain in the film is irure to condemn,
	     in the pleasure it wants to escape from the pain of being clum in pain, none result. They are the exceptions the blinds yearn for, they do not see,
	     they are the ones who abandon their responsibilities to the fault that is soothing the soul's hardships.</p>
